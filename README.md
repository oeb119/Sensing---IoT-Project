Hi and welcome to my DE4 Sensing & IoT project.

This projects aimed to grab ticket prices from trains and planes going from London to Paris on any day between December 20th and December 27th.

The train ticket prices are grabbed using data scraping via a crawler, and the flight prices are found using FlightAPI.

The results are communicated via a Telegram Bot, GroundTravel. Through this bot, the user can take various actions, such as visualising how the prices have evolved over the past few days in a graph, or sending a email to the local MP urging for greener travel if flights are cheaper than planes.

I have removed all personal API access keys (ThingSpeak and Gmail)

Happy reading!
